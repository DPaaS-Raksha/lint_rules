Containers must implement the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks by explicitly dropping `ALL` capabilities at `securityContext.capabilities.drop` in the container. Once `ALL` capabilities have been dropped, `add` back only the capabilities required for the container to function properly.

### Linter Rule
**ContainerHasDropAll** - Containers must be dropping all capabilities, and only adding the ones they need.

#### Severity
ERROR


#### Passing Examples

**Example: Container drops ALL capabilities**

_pod.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    spec:
      containers:
      - securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
    

<hr>


#### Failing Examples

**Example: Container does not drop ALL capabilities**

_pod.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    spec:
      containers:
      - securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - NOT ALL
