A Service `spec.selector` matching no Pods is usually a mistake because Services typically direct traffic to a logical set of Pods. Ensure that the Service is intended to be backed by something other than a group of Pods.

### Linter Rule
**ServiceSelectorMatchesPod** - Each Service's selector should match at least one Pod.

#### Passing Examples

**Example: Service selector matching a pod**

_pod.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers: []
    

_svc.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    kind: Service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: my-app
    

<hr>


#### Failing Examples

**Example: Service selector not matching any pod**

_deployment.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    kind: Deployment
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers: []
    

_pod.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    kind: Pod
    spec:
      containers: []
    

_svc.yaml (rendered from test default)_:

    kind: Service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: my-app
